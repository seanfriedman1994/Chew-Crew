##    Dishes: Dishes are created within an event. Each dish can have a picture, name, description, and tags (Gluten Free, Vegetarian, etc.). These dishes are added to an event by users who will be bringing that dish to the event, this way users can see what each person is bringing to the event. Once a dish is added it is dynamically added to the event page. Users have the ability to add any dish to their favorites which will make it appear inside their profile page.
